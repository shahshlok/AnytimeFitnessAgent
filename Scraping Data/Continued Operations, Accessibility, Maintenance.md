# Continued Operations, Accessibility, and Maintenance

Anytime Fitness may modify, change, suspend, terminate, or discontinue the operation of its websites or the provision of any services at any time without notice. Anytime Fitness also reserves the right to refuse service to anyone at any time, with or without cause.

## Our Commitment to Accessibility

Anytime Fitness is committed to accessibility, diversity, and inclusion. Our mission is to provide the highest level of service to everyone, including those accessing our website using assistive technologies like a screen reader, a magnifier, voice recognition software, or switch technology.

We are actively working to improve the accessibility of our sites and apps and are in the process of implementing functional improvements consistent with the World Wide Web Consortiumâ€™s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Level AA (WCAG 2.0 AA).

### Steps We Are Taking to Improve Accessibility

*   **Site Structure:** We are working to use proper headings, lists, paragraphs, and other formatting features so that anyone can easily use the site with assistive technology.
*   **Text Equivalents:** We are working to ensure our images and multimedia are accessible through alternative text, captions, and transcripts for those who cannot see images or hear audio.
*   **Full Keyboard Access:** We are working to ensure our sites and apps can be fully accessed using only a keyboard.
*   **Site Consistency:** We build our sites and apps with consistent layouts and functionality, so once you understand how they work, the experience remains predictable.
