Our commitment to accessibility

At Anytime Fitness, we’re committed to accessibility, diversity and inclusion. Whether you’re accessing this website using assistive technologies like a screen reader, a magnifier, voice recognition software, or switch technology, our mission is to provide the highest level of service that we can.

Steps we’ve taken to improve accessibility

Here are some of the items we’ve addressed to make sure our Sites and Apps are easy to use.

Site Structure- We use appropriate headings, lists, paragraphs and other formatting features on the sites so that anyone can easily use the Sites with assistive technology.

Text Equivalents- People who either can’t see images or hear audio may need some form of a text equivalent to interact with our Sites. We are working to ensure all of our images and multimedia are fully accessible through alternative text, captions and transcripts.

Full Keyboard Access- Everything we build can be accessed using a keyboard.

Site Consistency- We’re consistent in the way we build our Sites and Apps so that once you understand how our menus and pages work, you can count on our Sites to be consistent and function the same way every time you interact with them.
