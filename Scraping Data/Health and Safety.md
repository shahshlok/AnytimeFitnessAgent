# Health and Safety Protocols at Anytime Fitness

We are committed to keeping our members, guests, and staff safe. We have established enhanced safety and cleaning measures to ensure a responsible gym environment.

## Key Safety Measures

#### CLEANLINESS ENSURED
Our cleaning protocols are designed to keep everyone safe. Professional cleaners are hired to maintain high standards. Our teams are trained to ensure the entire facility is cleaned thoroughly at regular intervals with high-grade medical products.

#### SANITIZING STATIONS
The number of hygiene stations has been increased throughout the club. We provide cleanliness communication and hygiene tips to ensure individuals are safe during their workouts.

#### SOCIAL DISTANCING
Workout zones have been arranged to support social distancing. You will find markings, signs, and posters throughout the club to assist with this. Some machines may be temporarily out of order or relocated to ensure safe spacing. If you are unsure, please ask a staff member for assistance.

#### AC & VENTILATION
Our cooling and ventilation systems are set to meet recommended government standards and safety protocols. All cooling systems and air filters are regularly disinfected.

#### CROWD MANAGEMENT
A gym reservation system may be used to book workout slots, which helps control the number of people in the gym at one time to support social distancing. Please check with your home club for their specific procedures and ensure your contact information is up to date to receive communications.
