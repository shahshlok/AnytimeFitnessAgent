     - Privacy Policy
     - Terms and Conditions
     - And more

### Technical Implementation

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Uses environment variables for API key management
   - Implements OpenAI client initialization
   - Loads documents from the "Scraping Data" directory

2. **Document Processing**
   - Automatically uploads all markdown files to OpenAI's system
   - Creates a vector store for efficient document retrieval
   - Maintains file IDs for reference

3. **Chat Interface**
   - Implements a continuous chat loop
   - Uses a sophisticated system prompt that:
     - Positions the AI as a human receptionist
     - Enforces professional and friendly communication

     - Ensures concise responses
   - Handles user input and provides appropriate responses
   - Includes error handling and graceful exit functionality

4. **Response Generation**
   - Uses GPT-4 for response generation
   - Integrates with vector store for context-aware responses
   - Maintains conversation history for context
   - Formats responses in a user-friendly way

### Key Features

1. **Human-like Interaction**
   - The system is designed to mimic a human receptionist
   - Avoids AI-related terminology
   - Maintains a professional and friendly tone

2. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrates information from multiple documents
   - Provides accurate, context-aware responses
   - Gracefully handles queries outside its knowledge base

3. **Error Handling**
   - Includes comprehensive error handling
   - Provides user-friendly error messages
   - Maintains conversation flow even when errors occur

### Usage
The system is designed to:
1. Start up and initialize the knowledge base
2. Present a chat interface to users
